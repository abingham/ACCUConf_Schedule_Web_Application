# ACCU 2017 Elm-based schedule app

This is an Elm-based web application for browsing the ACCU 2017 conference
schedule.

The structure of this project is largely derived from the
excellent [Elm Tutorial](https://www.elm-tutorial.org/).

To build and run the app, make sure you've installed:

- a recent version of node.js (>= 6.0.0)](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
- [Elm 0.18.x](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html)

## Configuring the environment

The app reads certain configuration information from the file `.env`. You can
find an example of this file in `dot.env`. Before you can run the system, you
need to copy `dot.env` to `.env` and edit it as approporiate, for example:

```
cp dot.env .env
vi .env
```

The default configuration should be good for local development purposes, but
you'll want to use different environments for various deployment scenarios.

## Building

First install the necessary npm dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Then build the Elm code:
```
npm run build
```

If this succeeds, the compiled and web-packed code will be in the `dist`
directory.

## Running the development server

For development purposes, we've included a simple server that provides the
necessary JSON to the web client. This is usually simpler to use than a full
local or remote version of the ACCU website.

To use this, you'll first need to
install [node-foreman](https://github.com/strongloop/node-foreman):

```
npm install -g foreman
```

You can then use node-foreman to run the API server along with a simple server
for the web client:

``` nf start ```

After that the app should be available on http://localhost:3000.

When the development server is running, it will monitor changes to the source
code and recompile/redeploy as necessary. This is probably what you want to do
if you're hacking around in the code; it provides a very responsive edit-run
cycle.
