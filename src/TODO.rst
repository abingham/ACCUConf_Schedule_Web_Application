* Better visual indication of what page we're on. Currently we don't tell users,
  e.g., when they;re on the agenda page. Probably just pop up a title somewhere.

* Use wrappedColumn for displaying cards. This will give us a lot of stuff for
  free, I think.

* Display error messages on failed data fetches

* Improve ordering/display of agenda. The cards should probably be ordered by time and split up by days.

* Sticky footer

* How to calculate width of cards? Right now they're just hardcoded to 300.
