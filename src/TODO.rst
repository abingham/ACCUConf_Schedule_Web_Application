* Layout is all over the map. Need to simplify it. Some cards cross the view, others don't...not sure what's up.

* Display error messages on failed data fetches

* Improve ordering/display of agenda. The cards should probably be ordered by time and split up by days.

* Sticky footer

* How to calculate width of cards? Right now they're just hardcoded to 300.
